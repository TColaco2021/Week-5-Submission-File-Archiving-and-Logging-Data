# Week-5-Submission-File-Archiving-and-Logging-Data

### Step 1: Create, Extract, Compress, and Manage tar Backup Archives

Command to extract the TarDocs.tar archive to the current directory: tar xvvf TarDocs.tar

Command to create the Javaless_Doc.tar archive from the TarDocs/ directory, while excluding the TarDocs/Documents/Java directory: tar cvvf Javaless_Docs.tar --exclude=TarDocs/Documents/Java/TarDocs

Command to ensure Java/ is not in the new Javaless_Docs.tar archive: tar tvvf Javaless_Docs.tar | grep "Java"
Bonus

Command to create an incremental archive called logs_backup_tar.gz with only changed files to snapshot.file for the /var/log directory:  sudo tar czvvf logs_backup.tar.gz --listed-incremental = snapshot.snar /var/log 

### Critical Analysis Question

Why wouldn't you use the options -x and -c at the same time with tar? --create (-c) - would create a new tar archive and --extract (-x) would extract the entire archive or one or more files from an archive. Linux would only allow you to create an archive and then extract itâ€™s contents afterwards but not at the same time.

### Step 2: Create, Manage, and Automate Cron Jobs

Cron job for backing up the /var/log/auth.log file: 0 6 * * 3 tar czf /auth_backup.tgz /var/log/auth.log

### Step 3: Write Basic Bash Scripts

Brace expansion command to create the four subdirectories: mkdir -p /home/sysadmin/backups/{freemem,diskuse,openlist,freedisk}

Paste your system.sh script edits below:

 #!/bin/bash
Solution script contents: free -h > ~/backups/freemem/free_mem.txt 
du -h > ~/backups/diskuse/disk_usage.txt
lsof > ~/backups/openlist/open_list.txt 
df -h > ~/backups/freedisk/free_disk.txt

Command to make the system.sh script executable: sudo chmod +x system.sh

### Optional

Commands to test the script and confirm its execution: sudo ./system.sh
cd backups/diskuse, ls, cat disk_usage.txt
cd backups/freemem, ls, cat free_mem.txt
cd backups/freedisk, ls, cat free_disk.txt
cd backups/openlist, ls, cat open_list.txt

### Bonus

Command to copy system to system-wide cron directory: sudo mv system.sh /etc/cron.weekly/

### Step 4. Manage Log File Sizes

1. Run sudo nano /etc/logrotate.conf to edit the logrotate configuration file.

Add your config file edits below: sudo nano /etc/logrotate.conf
# see "man logrotate" for details
# rotate log files weekly
# weekly

# use the syslog group by default, since this is the owning group
# of /var/log/syslog.
# su root syslog

# keep 7 weeks worth of backlogs
# rotate 7


# create new (empty) log files after rotating old ones
# create


# uncomment this if you want your log files compressed
# delaycompress


#Do not rotate empty logs
notifempty


# packages drop log rotation information into this directory
# include /etc/logrotate.d

2. Configure a log rotation scheme that backs up authentication messages to the /var/log/auth.log [Your logrotate scheme edits here]

cd /etc/logrotate.d
cd nano auth
#!/bin/bash
/var/log/auth.log {
    rotate 7
    weekly
    notifempty
    compress
    delaycompress
    missingok
}

### Bonus: Check for Policy and File Violations

1. Command to verify auditd is active: systemctl status auditd (had to install program via sudo apt install auditd -y command)

2. Command to set number of retained logs and maximum log file size: sudo nano /etc/audit/auditd.conf

Add the edits made to the configuration file below:
- max_log_file = 35
- num_logs = 7

3. Command using auditd to set rules for /etc/shadow, /etc/passwd and /var/log/auth.log:
Enter the command sudo nano /etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules to set rules that watch the following paths:
Add the edits made to the rules file below: -w /etc/shadow -p wra -k hashpass_audit, -w /etc/passwd -p wra -k userpass_audit, - w /var/log/auth.log -p wra -k authlog_audit

4. Command to restart auditd: /sbin/service auditd

5. Command to list all auditd rules: command auditctl -l

6. Command to produce an audit report: aureport

7. Create a user with sudo useradd attacker and produce an audit report that lists account modifications: sudo useradd attacker and then aureport -m

8. Command to use auditd to watch /var/log/cron: auditctl -w /var/log/cron -p warx -k cron_file_change

9. Command to verify auditd rules: auditctl -s

### Bonus (Research Activity): Perform Various Log Filtering Techniques

1. Command that performs a log search that returns all messages, with priorities from emergency to error, since the current system boot.
journalctl -b -1  -p "emerg".."crit"

2. Command to check the disk usage of the system journal unit since the most recent boot: journalctl --disk-usage

3. Command to remove all archived journal files except the most recent two: sudo journalctl --vacuum-files=2

4. Command to filter all log messages with priority levels between zero and two, and save output to /home/sysadmin/Priority_High.txt: ? journalctl -p 0..2 > ~/home/sysadmin/Priority_High.txt

5. Command to automate the last command in a daily cronjob. Add the edits made to the crontab file below: crontab -e followed by 30 2 * * * journalctl -p 0..2 > ~/home/sysadmin/Priority_High.txt
